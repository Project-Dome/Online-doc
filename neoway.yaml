This price is determined by the most recent transaction for the item that added positive inventory, such as a purchase receipt, inventory transfer or inventory adjustment. (This does not include item returns or assembly unbuilds.) If two transactions are entered on the same day, the one entered later takes precedence and is used to calculate the last purchase price. When you use the Multiple-Location Inventory feature, the following is true: * The last purchase price reflects the most recent transaction at any location. * The Inventory subtab of inventory item records includes a link to the last positive-inventory transaction per location. * If multiple purchases are made on the same day with different prices and locations, then the highest price paid on that day becomes the last purchase price. If you use Multiple Units of Measure, the last purchase price is calculated using purchase units.'
